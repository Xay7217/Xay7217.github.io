Jose Martinez - jose9394158@gmail.com(the one I used for github)

I created the account today my username is Xay7217 and I personalized it with the thing I believe I'm going to need.

I created a public repository that is going to contain project files and revision history.

I downloaded the GitHub Desktop login into my account selected the repository I created picked the location where I wanted it saved on my computer and then cloned it.
